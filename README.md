Our team created an online web project which is an initiative dedicated to the conservation and protection of animals and their natural habitats. This report shows our work and inspirations from selecting WIX as our Content Management System (CMS) and pushing the web project codes/files to GitHub repository.


CHOOSING WIX CMS:
WIX was our choice Content Management System due to its user-friendly interface, a wide library of templates to choose from, more customization options and its ability to integrate with other developer tools. These features of WIX CMS aligned well with our WildGuardAfrica project objectives of creating a universal, informative, and appealing website. After comparing many different alternatives including Web Flow, WordPress, and Text Pattern we found that WIX was a perfect choice for our web project.


PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
Our project planning process started with outlining our goals and performing the planning phase. We defined our target audience and our project’s audience includes almost people of all ages as an SDG (13). We outlined the website’s structure and came up with the key objectives.
After the planning phase was done, we jumped into the design and implementation phase. Leveraging WIX’s templates, design tools and features, we crafted a visually appealing website that highlights the importance of animals and environment conservation.
Content creation- we crated content for our website, we researched and incorporated informative articles, sourced high-quality imagery and multimedia content, we also make sure that the information was well presented and was accurate and engaging.

During the project development process, we made sure that collaboration, communication and teamwork was undertaken among team members. We divided tasks among all team members based on one’s strengths and we also shared regular updates throughout the process in our WhatsApp group.

DATABASE:
We used Google Cloud MySQL Database for the web project:
 
 

PUSHING THE FILES TO GITHUB REPOSITORY:
We used GitHub for version control of our project and to make the project accessible to all team members and for collaboration purposes. We configured version control, ensuring that all team members could access and contribute to the project’s success.
 

Pushing the WildGuardAfrica project to GitHub was a smooth process and we used the developer mode of WIX Content Management System to link WIX with our GitHub account. 


 
On the other hand, we encountered minor challenges related to resolving merger conflicts and ensuring consistency in coding standards and also integrating different tools. Through effective communication and teamwork, these issues were promptly addressed, allowing us to maintain a clean and organized work.

CONCLUSION:
In conclusion, our experience of creating the WildGuardAfrica or AnimalsProtection website with WIX CMS and pushing the code files to GitHub was both rewarding and educational. We successfully leveraged WIX's features to develop a visually appealing, universal and informative platform dedicated to animal conservation. GitHub served as an invaluable tool for version control, facilitating seamless collaboration among team members.

ACKKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
We would like to express our gratitude to our lecturer for giving us a chance to gain experience with web projects development, Content Management Systems and using the GitHub platform. We also thank all team members who contributed to the success of the WildGuardAfrica project.
